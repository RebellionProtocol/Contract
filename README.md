# Contract
The Rebellion Protocol contract includes three main protocols, including Reflection tokenomics, an auto-liquidity generating mechanism and a fee taken on transactions to be redistributed to a single address (the investment fun of the project). Funds in this address are then used to make investments in crypto and other aseet classes, always bound to the community's consent adn decision. The development team has minted the tokens, created the liquidity on pancakeswap and sent the liquidity to team.finance to lock it. A fair launch was organized, whereby the devs had to partake in the public sale, like any other investors. No VC investment, no Pre-sale. Simple tokenomics, elegant design and strong vision has catered to the overall success of the project. Being 100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible. #RebellionProtocol join us on our journey to Saturn!
